This is the journey of a performance team, where asipiring trainees have to first audition to a company, and then train until they are good enough to debut!

They have to do the best they can in 3 categories: singing, rap, and, dance!

Audition is the superclass, Train is the subclass to Audition, and Debut is the subclass to Train 

I have added both a screenshot of the raw output, and annotated version that details what each line refers to.
